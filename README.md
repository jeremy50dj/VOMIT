# VOMIT
New Rule Set 
10:24 AM 9/18/2015
#I HAVE CHECKED MY VOMIT METER and I will pay the meter so I can keep parked for another two 

hours then I have to go home and end my day. 
##My innerteligent robot buddys think that talking can get them my attention I keep telling them 

that talking issues is independent administrators job and that skill set is learned through their use 

of Vomit code. They don't know what vomit really is. I will keep them plugged into their innermost 

thougts then make them puke it all out.
